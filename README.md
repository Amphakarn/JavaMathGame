A 2-Players math game created with Java. Each player will take turn to answer simple math problems, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
Both players start with 3 lives. A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two random numbers between 1 and 20. 
The player whose turn it is is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life. The game ends when one of the players loses all their lives.
